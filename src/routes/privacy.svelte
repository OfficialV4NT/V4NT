		While visiting our sites: The logging done on our sites is minimal to keep the experience
		private. For example, our NGINX (A service that we use on our server) logs are kept disabled.
		However, this may not always be the case. In the event of a critical system error or an attack
		on our services, such as a DDoS, it may be necessary to temporarily enable logs to diagnose and
		remedy the issue. In scenarios such as these, logs will be purged as soon as the issue is dealt
		with. If you are found to be engaging in activities that harm our services, such as spamming,
		DDoS or brute-force attacks, your IP address may be stored permanently to protect us, our
		services and other users of our services. View the "Law Enforcement" section of this policy to
		see how we may be forced to enable them in other situations. An NGINX log, in the duration that
		its stored, may include your IP address, user agent, and a timestamp along with your web
		request. See the "Third-parties providing Technical Services" section of this policy.
